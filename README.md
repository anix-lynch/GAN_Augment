# 📊 GANAugment: Dataset Augmentation with GANs in PyTorch

Welcome to **GANAugment**! This project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment datasets, particularly in cases of class imbalance. By creating synthetic data with GANs, you’ll enhance your dataset's diversity and improve model training outcomes. Let’s dive into the world of GANs and data augmentation! 🤖📈

## 🌐 Project Overview

GANs are powerful tools in deep learning that generate synthetic data by training two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator. The generator creates synthetic samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and synthetic data. In this project, we’ll build a GAN from scratch using PyTorch, applying it to augment a dataset with class imbalance. This method ensures that both classes are equally represented without duplicating or losing valuable samples.
